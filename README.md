This project was developed as part of my academic work to apply machine learning techniques in agriculture.
It recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil nutrients and environmental factors, helping farmers improve yield and efficiency.

The solution integrates Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost models into a STREAMLIT web app, making it easy for anyone to use through a simple browser interface.
 
 Academic Project: Showcases end-to-end ML workflow (data → training → deployment).

 Dataset: Contains N, P, K nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall.

 Models Used: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost.

 Deployment: Streamlit web app with interactive UI.

 Impact: Provides farmers with actionable insights for crop selection.
